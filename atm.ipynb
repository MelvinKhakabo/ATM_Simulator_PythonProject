    "## About the project\n",
    "A command-line ATM simulator that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as checking their balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, and exiting the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features:\n",
    "Menu Interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "Display a menu with options:\n",
    "Check Balance\n",
    "Deposit Money\n",
    "Withdraw Money\n",
    "Exit\n",
    "User Authentication:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulate a login process where the user enters a predefined PIN.\n",
    "Allow 3 attempts before locking the system.\n",
    "Functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Check Balance: Show the current account balance.\n",
    "Deposit Money: Allow the user to add an amount to their balance.\n",
    "Withdraw Money: Subtract an amount from the balance if sufficient funds are available.\n",
    "Prevent withdrawal if the amount exceeds the balance.\n",
    "Exit: End the program gracefully.\n",
    "Data Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a dictionary or variables to store user data (e.g., balance and PIN).\n",
    "Optionally, allow saving and loading data from a text file.\n",
    "Bonus Features (Optional):\n",
    "Transaction History: Keep a log of all transactions (deposits, withdrawals) and display it when requested.\n",
    "Multiple Accounts: Support multiple users with different PINs and balances.\n",
    "Persistent Data: Save the user data (e.g., balances and transactions) to a file so it persists between program runs."
